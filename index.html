  <!-- הסיפור שלי -->
  <section id="my-fashion-story" class="section">
    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>My journey into fashion started when I was around 14 or 15. I always loved clothes and dressing differently. I was drawn to unique colors, bold pieces, and got super inspired by streetwear creators I followed online. That early spark is still with me today.</p>
    <p>After finishing the army, I asked myself: What do I really want to do now? What’s my passion?<br> (Funny enough, I had that thought while shopping for clothes at the mall 😄)</p>
    <p>I started digging deeper into what I love about fashion, and slowly things began to take shape – suppliers, a website, designs, photo shoots, packaging, orders... And that’s how CLOUST was born.</p>

    <h2>My Inspirations</h2>
    <p>I get inspired by stylists, fashion designers, and creators I follow online – people who know how to mix bold choices with real personality. Fashion exhibitions also give me ideas I wouldn’t think of on my own.
    	I love using visual tools like Pinterest and Coolors to explore color palettes and moods.
	    But most of all, I experiment with my own clothes – trying bold combinations, layering pieces, and seeing what works. That’s when inspiration really hits: in the mirror, not just on the screen.

  <section id="sketch-to-street" class="section">
    <h2>Sketch to Street</h2>
    <p>After getting inspired, I sketch the idea either by hand or directly in Adobe Illustrator. From there, I refine the concept with my own twist and turn it into a full design.
	Once it’s ready, I contact the supplier to work on patterns, sizing, and fabrics. I choose the right materials depending on the season. Then I handle pricing, packaging, shipping, and finally – I bring it to life on the website, ready to be worn in the real world.

    <h2>Creative Collaborations</h2>
    <p>One of our most exciting collaborations was with a dance crew called Ginga – inspired by our love for hip-hop culture and street style.
    	We designed custom shirts and hats just for them, and they brought our vision to life with a high-energy performance that mixed fashion and movement in the coolest way.
	</p>
    <p>This is how we brought it to life.🎬</p>

      <h2>Link to another collab we did</h2>
      <p>Here you can see a video by a stand-up comedian, host, and voice actor who's gone viral on TikTok. We did a fun collab with him – just like we did with the dancers. We gave him shirts with our custom design, and he created a video wearing them and gave us a shoutout to help generate traffic and reach new people.</p>

  <section class="section" id="What-I-Learned">
  <h2>Things I Learned</h2>
  <p>By building this website, I learned how the foundation of HTML and CSS works together to create a full visual layout.
       I now understand what different HTML tags do, how they affect the structure of a page, and how to use them correctly.
       In CSS, I learned how to style elements in creative ways, control layout with Flexbox and Grid, and make the design responsive for different screen sizes.
       I also practiced keeping a consistent style using colors, fonts, spacing, and transitions.
       Additionally, I used JavaScript to add simple interactivity to the site – like the image popup, the changing text, and the animated menu.
       This helped me understand how to connect logic with design and create a better user experience.</p>
  <p>I also learned how to keep my code clean and organized so that others (like teammates or testers) can read and understand it easily.</p>
